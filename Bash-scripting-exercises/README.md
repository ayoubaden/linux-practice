# Bash Scripting Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for 4 Bash scripting exercises:

1. **Basic Arithmetic** – Takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **File Operations** – Creates a directory, a file inside it, writes text, and displays the contents.
3. **Conditional Statements** – Checks if a file exists, and whether it is readable, writable, or executable.
4. **Backup Script** – Copies all `.txt` files from a specified directory to a backup directory, creating the backup folder if necessary.

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.
